# PillSafety

At HackMIT, my team used Node-RED, IBM Watson's visual recognition service, and a Raspberry Pi to create Pill Safety. 

Our goal with the project is to reduce the opioid epidemic by adding AI to pharmaceutical prescription containers for ensuring proper ownership of medication as drug theft is becoming more prevalent. 

I was happy to work on training the visual recognition model and setting up node-red to send/receive pictures from the Raspberry Pi through Dropbox. It was much easier than expected because of IBM's platforms.

My team and I won IBMâ€™s 1st place prize for the best use of their visual recognition service. We couldn't have done it without Markus Van Kempen and Travis Siegfried. Their invaluable mentorship was key to our success and we would like to thank them for their help.
